# Walker Breaker
#### A brick breaker game!

I started thinking about what game I would like to make for my first project by listing games I enjoyed playing and thinking about what theme I could tie into it to not only make it fun for me to create but also for the user.

One of my favorite shows is The Walking Dead, if you watch it then you might really enjoy what I have planned in the future for this game! When I first thought out my project, the end result I had in mind was for player 1 & 2 to be able choose what character they would battle a hoard of walkers (wall of cartoonified walker heads instead of bricks ) with. The ball, or weapon, would have been that characters respective weapon from the show as a small icon instead of just a plain circle. Each player would have 3 lives to help Daryl (Crossbow), Michonne (Katana), Rick (Gun), Glenn(Baseball bat) or Carol(Sniper Rifle) to finish off the walkers, who ever makes the most kills (points) wins, if both players have an equal score then the winner is determined based on the time it took to finish off all the roamers.

In order to create Walker Breaker I used Javascript, CSS, HTML5, jQuery. The HTML element I used to create the working parts of the game was canvas.

I was not very confident with using canvas so I tried to learn as much as I could through tutorials, I :heart: tutorials! Also I :heart: MDN. Most of my time was spent reading other peoples brick breaker game code, watching videos on how to do it, followed by breaking my code and wearing out my command + Z keys.


#### How to play Walker Breaker
The game plays as soon as the page load, there is music so turn the volume up!

You can control the paddle with either the mouse or the :arrow_left:  or :arrow_right: keys

There are many things that I had in my original idea of what this is going to turn out to be that are not currently present but hope to add very soon.

###### Unsolved Problems
* Walker Breaker is currently a 1 player game, Brick breaker is often just a one player game, check back though, the 2 player version will blow your mind! :dizzy_face: :dash:
* No ability to choose when game starts, so you better be ready!
* No pause/resume play
